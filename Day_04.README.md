### Inheritence

Types of inhritence : 

    1. Single level Inheritence
    2. Multi level Inheritence 
    3. multiple Inheritence 
    4. Hireralchichal Inheritence
    5. Hybrid Inheritence


* Java do not support multiple Inheritence and hybrid Inheritece bcz due to ambiguity problem

* Abstraction : Hidding unneccesary details from the user and showing user interface to the user 

* Encapsulation : wrapping up of some block of code (ie data and methods which perform some task on  
  that data) in a single unit called class, it says data should be private and method should be public.
  because : 

* Polymorphism : more than one from of a method 
types of polymorphism 

    1. compile Time Polymorphism (Static Binding / Early Binding) 
      achieved through method overloading => we can make a method of a same name and even same time but no of parameter must differ and it is known as method overloading
    2. Run time Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding / Late Binding)
      achived through method overiding => Changing the definition of existing method in child class
      then we have to write same name and parameter of paraent class in child class and this is called method overriding.


* Dynamic polymorphic Assignment (DPA)

when we assign a child class obj into parent class reference variable is known as DPA
by the help of DPA we get run time polymorphism

Abstract class => a class which we cannot instantiate is knowm as abstract class
the class whose object we cannot creat is known as abstract class

An abstract class may have abstract method 


* How to call a constructor of abstract class


* Abstract Method => A method which do not have a body is known as abstract method.

 utility of abstarct class => 

* Interview Question : if we make constructor in abstract how we call it
we make a child class and make a object of child class
