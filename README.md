### Day : 1

- How to print \n in c/cpp
* put \\n in quotes

Programming language -> convertor software (Interpreter) -> Binary language

Interpreter => check code line by line 
Compiler => check whole code at once

OOP approach features
* Class => Blueprint of object
* Object => Basic runtime entity, which allocate memory at run time
* Encapsulation => wrapping of data in a single entity
* Abstraction => Hiding implimentation and only showing user Inrerface
* Inheritence => Copying of properties
* Polymorphism => More than one form

** RULES OF IDENTIFIERS

Menbers of class

* constructor => Allocate memory to the variables
* Destructor => Dellocate memory of variables
* Method => member function of class
* variable => data storing location name

** Problem in c/cpp
they are system dependent 

to fix this problem 
The Sun Micro System
by James Gosling

and maked a language named :- OAK language
later but this language name changed to JAVA(1995)

* JAVA FEATURES

*   Architectural Neutral
*   Plateform Independent (acc to JVM)
*   Java is Secure
*   Follow OOA 
*   Robust (does't crash easily)
*   Java is Internationalized
*   Java is compiled-interpreted-compile
*   Multithreaded Environment
*   Portable
*   

{! Why c\cpp is a platform dependent

for Windows  one.c -> compile -> one.exe

for Linux  one.c -> compile -> one.out
}
But in java -> compile -> one.class(byte code) and this file will run on every system
acc to compatible JVM

one.class => Windows JVM
one.class => Linux JVM
one.class => Mac JVM
are different (JVM is a platform dependent)

* Secure

Java is more secure than other languages bcz its program run through JRE (java runtime environment) and the os run this JRE 

* java doesn't suppot pointers so there is no memory leak
* java works on uni code (0 - 65,535)
