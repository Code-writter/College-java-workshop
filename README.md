### Day : 1

- How to print \n in c/cpp
* put \\n in quotes

Programming language -> convertor software (Interpreter) -> Binary language

Interpreter => check code line by line 
Compiler => check whole code at once

OOP approach features
* Class => Blueprint of object
* Object => Basic runtime entity, which allocate memory at run time
* Encapsulation => wrapping of data in a single entity
* Abstraction => Hiding implimentation and only showing user Inrerface
* Inheritence => Copying of properties
* Polymorphism => More than one form

** RULES OF IDENTIFIERS

Menbers of class

* constructor => Allocate memory to the variables
* Destructor => Dellocate memory of variables
* Method => member function of class
* variable => data storing location name

** Problem in c/cpp
they are system dependent 

to fix this problem

The Sun Micro System (presently Oracle)
by James Gosling

and maked a language named :- OAK language
later but this language name changed to JAVA(1995)

* JAVA FEATURES

*   Architectural Neutral
*   Plateform Independent (acc to JVM)
*   Java is Secure
*   Follow OOA 
*   Robust (does't crash easily)
*   Java is Internationalized
*   Java is compiled-interpreted-compile
*   Multithreaded Environment
*   Portable
   

{! Why c\cpp is a platform dependent

for Windows  one.c -> compile -> one.exe

for Linux  one.c -> compile -> one.out
}
But in java -> compile -> one.class(byte code) and this file will run on every system
acc to compatible JVM

one.class => Windows JVM
one.class => Linux JVM
one.class => Mac JVM
are different (JVM is a platform dependent)

* Secure

Java is more secure than other languages bcz its program run through JRE (java runtime environment) and the os run this JRE 

* java doesn't suppot pointers so there is no memory leak
* java works on uni code (0 - 65,535)

How to create object in java

classname referencevariable = new classname();
                \
            identifier
Ex:-
    Foo f=new Foo();

JDK (java development environment)

JRE (java runtime environment)

JVM (java virtual machine)


* variabls
    they are of two types 

        1 local  => only accasible inside the scope of specific block
        2 Global =>  a variable which is shared by all the methos of the class and it can be accessed out side of the class if variable is public  (accasibble throughout the programme) 

        Global variable are of two types
            Instance var or non static var
            class var or static var

* Diff btw static and non static variable
